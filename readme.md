Eigenvalue Calculation Program: This C program calculates eigenvalues of a 3x3 matrix using the Power Iteration method. The usage of this program: INPUT: Enter the 3*3 matrix when prompted. press 'Enter' or "space bar" to enter the next element of the matrix. OUTPUT: The program will print the eigen values of the given matrix.

In the program <math.h>,<stdbool.h> libraries are used. ENVIRONMENTAL SETUP: Make sure you have the GCC compiler installed on your system. ALGORITHM: The program uses the Power Iteration method to find the largest eigenvalue of the input matrix. It then calculates the remaining eigenvalues using the characteristic equation. COMPILATION: 1.Open a terminal window in the directory containing the source code. EXECUTION: 1.Run the compiled program in 2.Enter the 3x3 matrix when prompted. Each matrix element should be separated by a space, and each row should be on a new line. ->For the input matrix:

... Enter the elements of 3x3 matrix : 1 2 3 3 2 1 2 1 3 ...

->The program will give the output:

... The eigen values are : 6.000000 1.414214 -1.414214 ...

NOTE: 1.The eigenvalues are calculated by using Power Iteration method ,the convergence error is set to be 0.0001. 2.Enter the inputs accurately for precise results.
